Web Technologies Review 3
=========================
Continue with 'validation.html' and add a text input field 
for player age
Write a <span> with an error message and initially
 hide it using class='hideError'
Add a 'blur' event listener to your new form field
Show the error if the age value is less than 18
Remember to hide the error again when the field is valid

Optional
--------
Modify the score and age validation tests to also check the value 
is a whole number (Math.round)


Write <h2>Game Play</h2> and apply css colour to 
the background and text of this tag
Write a <select> tag and <option> tags 
for game level (e.g. 'low' 'medium' 'high') --drop down
Add a 'change' event listener which applies 
css to the h2 depending on the skill level
  e.g. choosing a level would show green amber or red colour
listener change, setAttribute to change color

When the user submits the form run all the validation checks again 
and show/hide 

messages depending on the validation results. 
If everything is ok show a message 

thanking the user for their data

Find a way to show everythnig 
the user entered ONLY if all the validation is ok
