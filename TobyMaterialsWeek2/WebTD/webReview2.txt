Web Technologies Review Exercise 2     see https://pastebin.com/xr9Uymbm
==================================     until about 2:30 ish
Build a single-page-app to get the current weather for a given city/country.
There is an example solution HERE: https://pastebin.com/R2XwCBP4
Create a new HTML file called 'weather.html' (alongside my-app.html)

Make use of the loadingData example (either xhr or fetch) but using this URL:
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=galway,ie&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1

Initially just get the JSON and show it using console.log() or inside a <pre> tag

Then give the user two form fields, one for the city and the other for the country. Also provide a button. Add an event listener to the button.
Inside the event listener, read what the user entered for city and country
Then make a call to the weather service url, replacing 'galway,ie' with the new values (use back-ticks and ${} systax)

Finally, show the weather description on the page
    e.g.
	let desc=data.weather[0].description
	output.innerHTML = desc

Optional
========
Show the temperature and wind speed on the page
Convert the temperature to Celcius (-273) and use the degrees symbol &deg;
Give the user a drop-down to choose the country instead of typing it
