Web Technologies: review exercise 1
===================================
Create a new html5 page (or continue with about-me.html)
Structure all the content into articles and sections
Write a couple of paragraphs about your hobbies/interests
In a table, show your qualifications and/or experience
Write an un-ordered list of your favourite sports/books/films/countries/anything
Within a 'nav' tag, create hyperlinks to three websites that you like

  e.g.   <a href='https://duckduckgo.com'>duck search</a>

This time, show the links on separate lines (instead of next to each other)

Use a definition list to (loosely) define what is meant by 'ul' and 'ol' in html
Add one or more images of things you like (e.g. jokes/characters/places/food/anything)

Add a few 'hr' tags to visually break the page flow

Optional
--------
Add a form asking the user to fill in:
- favourite website (as a url)
- date of birth (as a date)
- shoe-size (as a range)
- favourite colour (as a color)
